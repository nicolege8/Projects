**I'm Nicole Ge, a current freshman at Harvey Mudd studying computer science and mathematics.

I am interested in AI and ML and just finished working on a project where I was part of the AI team and we created the algorithm to detect deception in user-generated analysis through facial and sentiment analysis models. Some files are linked here (we primarily worked in person):

I plan to update my Github with more personal projects in the near future!
